# web-development
- follow the book `Node.js in Action`
- MySQL replace Redis used in the book
- use `Promise` and `async/await` instead of `callback`, but I also provide `callback` implement for some modules.
- some latest libraries are used because libraries used in the book have been deprecated or out-of-date.
